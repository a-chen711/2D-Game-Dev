# 2D Game Development for Fun!
I have always had a passion for video games, and since I've accumulated enough knowledge to work on VR applications using the Unity Engine, I wanted to try my hand at some game dev! I'm making slow but steady progress and I hope to one day release a game as a passion project!

Projects:
- [Flappy Bird Replica](https://sites.google.com/view/a-chen711/projects-publications/game-development-projects/flappy-bird-remake?authuser=0) - Practice Project
- Sunnyland 2D Platformer - **WIP**
