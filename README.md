# 2D Game Development for Fun!
I have always had a passion for video games, and since I've accumulated enough knowledge to work on VR applications using the Unity Engine, I wanted to try my hand at some game dev! I'm starting with 2D games just to get the hang of it, but eventually I want to create some 3D game ideas I have. I'm making slow but steady progress and I hope to one day release a game as a passion project!
